Modularity Demonstration
=========

## Description 

This pilot demonstrates the possibilities of applying Modularity with OSGi. 
OSGi is a set of specifications which, in its core specification, defines a component and a service model. The most important advantage of OSGi is that every component can define its API via a bundle of exported packages and that every component can specify its required dependencies. The components and services can be dynamically installed, activated, de-activated, updated and de-installed.
