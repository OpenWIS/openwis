Distributed Metrics Tracing Module
=========

## Description 
This pilot suggests a common communication module which will gather predefined metrics from remote WIS systems. The module will analyse the
collected data and produce useful reports, and/or statistical data about WIS utilization 


## Features 
- Gathering module 
- Analysis module (Grafana - influx DB)
- Reporting mechanisms 



## Complexity / Effort Estimation 

Complexity     | Effort
-------- | ---
Infrastructure | 10 %
 Gathering module| 30 %
 Analysis module| 30 %
 Reporting module| 30 %



## WIS 2.0 relevance
"WIS 2.0 will offer mechanisms to increase collaborative development, maintenance
and support of services, promote the exchange of best practices and enable the uptake of new
Technologies"
