--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--- Changes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Changed ApplicationHandler interface

- Changed HttpServiceRequest : now if contentDisposition is given then 'no cache'
  lines are ignored (fixed a problem with IExplorer6)

- Removed 'type' attribute when specifying services. It was used to specify XML
  services. Now the service's type is automatically detected using the content type.

- Used Java 5 varargs for dbms select and execute methods

- Now the dbms.abort method does not throw exceptions anymore. It just returns
  a boolean value indicating success or failure

- Removed proxy settings from config file. Now proxies are handled externally.

- Accepted 'application/xml' in POST/multipart requests to return xml data

- Added proxy support to XmlRequest

- Substituted cos.jar with jakarta commons fileupload

- HttpServiceRequest: changed 'Expires' value from '0' to '-1'

--- Bugs fixed
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  an exception

- Fixed command string in HTTP/1.0 XML requests

- Fixed bug in BinaryFile : the 'copy' had a wrong termination test causing file
  corruption

- Fixed bug in JeevesException : the xml object was not detached by its parent

- Now an empty service will trigger the default one.

- Fixed validation using JDK 1.5 features
