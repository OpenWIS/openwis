/*
 * $Log: XPath.java,v $
 * Revision 1.7  2002/01/31 22:42:19  gwheeler
 * Updated javadocs.
 *
 * Revision 1.6  2002/01/28 21:23:31  gwheeler
 * Fixed findTarget to return the correct result.
 * Added an overloaded version of getXpath to use when the caller already knows
 * the node's parent, to save work in here.
 *
 * Revision 1.5  2002/01/25 16:14:16  gwheeler
 * Made changes to increase efficiency. Realized that several node types
 * (Element, EntityRef, ProcessingInstruction, etc.) have getParent() methods
 * and it is quite easy to walk up the tree from the node to the root. This is
 * much better than walking down the tree to the node.
 *
 * Revision 1.4  2001/12/12 14:55:44  gwheeler
 * Consolidated the code that adjusts from origin-1 counting (as used
 * in Xpath) to origin-0 counting (as needed by the code).
 *
 * Modified some code to account for namespaces.
 *
 * Revision 1.3  2001/10/15 18:34:55  gwheeler
 * Added method getChildXPath to get the relative path from a parent
 * to one of its children. There was similar code in DifferenceFinder,
 * but that was changed to use this method.
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2001/10/11 15:51:05  gwheeler
 * Modified the class so it now supports enough xpath to understand
 * the content of an Element.
 *
 * Revision 1.1.1.1  2001/10/04 18:52:54  gwheeler
 *
 *
 * Revision 1.6  2001/07/13 20:15:10  gwheeler
 * Made constructor private so class cannot be instantiated.
 *
 * Revision 1.5  2001/06/27 18:23:19  gwheeler
 * Fixed followXPath to check for siblings with same name and generate index number
 * if necessary.
 *
 * Changed getElement so it doesn't add a temporary parent to the root element. It turns out
 * the parent wasn't temporary, and making a second call to the method would fail because
 * the node already had a parent.
 *
 * Revision 1.4  2001/06/22 18:12:03  gwheeler
 * Minor changes to match changes in other classes.
 *
