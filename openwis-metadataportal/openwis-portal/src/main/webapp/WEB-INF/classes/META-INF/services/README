By default XSL caching is active.

The javax.xml.transform.TransformerFactory file is used to define
the XSL processor to use.
 * de.fzi.dbs.xml.transform.CachingTransformerFactory for XSL caching
(recommended value for production use).
 * net.sf.saxon.TransformerFactoryImpl to use Saxon
 
When caching is on, only the main XSL stylesheet
last update date is checked and not all included XSL. If you update
an included stylesheet, cache is still used.
