			The GeoNetwork search engine allows you to search on the following fields
			<ul>
				<li>Title</li>
				<li>Abstract</li>
				<li>Keywords</li>
				<li>Location</li>
				<li>Free text (any metadata field)</li>
			</ul>
			In each search fields the user can write expressions using the following grammar:
			<ul>
				<li>string: search metadata having "string"' in field</li>
				<li>string1 string2: equivalent to string1 and string2</li>
				<li>"string1 string2": search metadata having the "string1 string2" in field</li>
				<li>string1 and string2: search metadata having both "string1" and "string2" in field</li>
				<li>string1 or string2: search metadata having either 'string1' or "string2" in field</li>
				<li>string1 not string2: search metadata having "string1" but not "string2" in field</li>
			</ul>
			Keywords and operators (and, or not) are not case sensitive.
			<p/>
			For instance, in the title field:
			<p/>
			anchorage map: search for all metadata containing the words "anchorage" and "map" in the title;<br/>
			"anchorage map": search for all metadata containing the text "anchorage map" in the title;<br/>
			"anchorage map" not roads: search for all metadata containing the text "anchorage map" but not the word "roads" in the title.
			<p/>
			In the remote search the user can select multiple servers from the list; as an alternative, the user can select a profile; this automatically selects all servers defined for that profile. For instance, the GeoNetwork profile selects all GeoNetwork servers providing remote search capabilities.<br/>
			Since remote Z39.50 transactions can be very slow, the user can define a timeout for the transaction of 10, 20 and 30 seconds.

			<p/>
			Spatial data that can be found in the GeoNetwork is often used as basic data in advanced web-based applications. These applications target specific problems related to agriculture, livestock, forests, fisheries and food security issues.<br/>
			The user will be provided with links to these related applications.<br/>
			Related applications will also allow the user to see what other spatial data makes part of the application.<br/>
			Related applications can in some cases directly be viewed through the GeoNetwork Dynamic Map interface.
			<p/>
			<a name="3"/><h3>Downloading spatial data</h3>
			Spatial data is often available for download. Data is provided in data formats that are compatible with most professional GIS applications and a variety of freeware GIS tools.<br/>
			Downloadable data has a link to proceed for download. You will have to aggree with the download conditions and a disclaimer. You are asked to provide your personal details, and are kindly invited to provide us with feedback on your intended use of the data.<br/>
			A number of datasets will allow you to only download an area of interest.
