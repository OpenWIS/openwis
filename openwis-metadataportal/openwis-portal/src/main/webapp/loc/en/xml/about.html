<h1>THE WIS</h1>
</p>
<p>The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has been working for several years towards
	upgrading its global infrastructure to support all of its international programmes of work, both
	operational and research-based, to collect, share and disseminate information. The new infrastructure
	is called the WIS, the WMO Information System, and identifies three top level functions. These are:
	<br/>
	GISC: Global Information System Centre
	<br/>
	DCPC: Data Collection and Production Centre
	<br/>
	NC: National Centre
</p>
<br>
<br/>
<h1>OPENWIS PORTALS</h1>
<P>Portals, based on the OpenWIS software and coupled with the existing systems, perform the three
	functions required by the WMO Information System.
	<br/>
	All three functions contribute to the circulation of priority data, system wide security, monitoring and
	implementation of WMO data policies. GISCs and DCPCs allow the Discovery Access and Retrieval
	of data, products and services offered by WIS Centres, but GISCs offer a global view of this
	information and provide distributed and resilient access to critical data and product.
