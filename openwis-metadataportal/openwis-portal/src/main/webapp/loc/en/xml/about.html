	<span lang="EN-US">The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has been
		working for several years towards upgrading its global
		infrastructure to support all of its international programmes of
		work, both operational and research-based, to collect, share and
		disseminate information. The new infrastructure is called the WIS,
		the WMO Information System, and identifies three top-level
		functions. These are:</span>
</p>
<ul type="disc" style="margin-top: 0cm;">
	<li>GISC: Global Information System Centre;</li>
	<li>DCPC: Data Collection and Production Centre;</li>
	<li>NC: National Centre.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<span lang="EN-US">
		All three functions contribute to the circulation of
		priority data,
		system wide security, monitoring and implementation of
		WMO data
		policies. GISCs and DCPCs allow the Discovery Access and
		Retrieval
		of data, products and services offered by WIS Centres, but
		GISCs
		offer a global view of this information and provide distributed
		and
		resilient access to critical data and products.</span>
</p>

		OpenWIS aims to
		perform the three functions required
		by the WMO Information
		System
		that is, GISC, DCPC and NC.</span>

	<strong>GeoNetwork opensource</strong>
	is a standardized and decentralized spatial information management
	environment, designed to enable access to geo-referenced databases,
	cartographic products and related metadata from a variety of sources,
	enhancing the spatial information exchange and sharing between
	organizations and their audience, using the capacities of the
	internet. This approach of geographic information management aims at
	facilitating a wide community of spatial information users to have
	easy and timely access to available spatial data and to existing
	thematic maps that might support informed decision making.
